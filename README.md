# Kitchen Express Web App
## Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Visual Studio Text Editor
## Description:
For this project, we were provided with HTML, CSS and Javscript code that is used in the "Kitchen Express" web app which is an app that tracks the orders of customers from the moment they are taken to the moment it is served. 
The project instructions required us to add logic to all remaining event handlers so the user stores are met.
